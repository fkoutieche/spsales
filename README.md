### Project Overview
Analyzed a dataset containing 10,000 transaction records from a supermarket chain to uncover insights into sales trends and customer purchasing behavior. Independently conducted the analysis over two weeks, using SQL to clean and structure the data and extract meaningful insights.

The findings offer actionable recommendations for sales and marketing teams, emphasizing strategies for seasonal promotions and efficient inventory management.
